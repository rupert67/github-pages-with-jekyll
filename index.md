# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about how to smoke in a Pit Boss pellet smoker.

I would like to start with something easy.  Sausage, my wife loves smoked sausge.  Normally I  use cookie trays with cookie racks on them so it raised what you are smoking off the sheet far enough so the smoke can get around whatever you are cooking.
